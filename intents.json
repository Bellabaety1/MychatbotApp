        ""Visit Rwanda" is a tourism campaign launched by the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) to promote Rwanda as a premier tourism destination. The campaign aims to attract both domestic and international tourists to the country by highlighting the country's unique cultural heritage, natural attractions, wildlife, and hospitality.

The campaign was launched in 2017, and since then, Rwanda has seen a steady growth in its tourism sector. The country has a lot to offer tourists, from gorilla trekking in Volcanoes National Park to cultural tours in traditional villages, from hiking in the stunningly beautiful Nyungwe Forest to visiting the Genocide Memorial sites.

The Visit Rwanda campaign has also attracted international attention through its partnerships with various organizations and events, such as Arsenal Football Club, NBA Africa, and the African Drone Forum, to name a few.

Overall, Visit Rwanda is an effort to showcase Rwanda's rich cultural and natural heritage and encourage people to visit and explore the country's beauty"
